&lt;b&gt;V1.01&lt;/b&gt;
This mod makes the drug Luciferium craftable. Access was always the biggest deterrent for me when deciding whether to administer Luciferium. In order to not completely throw off game balance, the crafting cost is fairly high per unit.
	
&lt;b&gt;Research prerequisites:&lt;/b&gt;
 - Medicine Production
 - Component Assembly
	 
&lt;b&gt;Crafts at the Drug Lab using:&lt;/b&gt;
 -  2x Advanced Component
 - 10x Uranium
 - 10x Gold
 - 10x Plasteel
 
&lt;b&gt;Skill requirement to craft:&lt;/b&gt;
 - 10 Crafting
 -  8 Medicine
	 
&lt;b&gt;VERSION 1.01 Changes:&lt;/b&gt;
 - Improved mod description (you're reading it).
 - Removed some random comments left behind from earlier.
 - Unfinished luciferium now looks like luciferium rather than an unfinished component.
 - Mod is now available on GitHub.
 - &lt;i&gt;Cried because I am now hooked on modding.&lt;/i&gt;
